The ReVolt model has been tested in the towing tankt at SINTF Ocean. Terje Rosten did a very nice job with preparing ReVolt for the test, and he also performed the test together with summerstudents at DNV GL GTR.
The raw data from the test is published here: <a href="https://github.com/DNVGLReVolt/dnvglrevolt.github.io/tree/master/towingtankResults">Results</a>


Thanks to Terje Rostet at NTNU/SINTEF for helping us out with this.
