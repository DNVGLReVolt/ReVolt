The ReVolt model is prepared for test in the towing tank next week. SINTEF is equiping ReVolt with tachometers to measure the rps of the stern thrusters. 
The same will be done with the bow thruster. 

Several tests will be performed:
- Towing tests with and without propellers
- Bollard pull tests with the stern thrusters with different speed and thrust direction commands
- Bollard pull test with the bow thruster with different speed and thrust direction commands

Thanks to NTNU and Sintef for helping us out with this.
