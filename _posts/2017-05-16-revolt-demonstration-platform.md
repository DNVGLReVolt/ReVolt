The ReVolt is an unmanned and zero-emission ship concept designed for short sea shipping along the coast of Norway. 
The ReVolt was design for low energy demand and the propulsion system is fully electric. The ReVolt has 2 stern pods and 1 retractable azimuth thruster in the bow.

A 1:20 scale model of the ReVolt has been built to explore and demonstrate the vessels autonomous capabilities and to test other design features.

Today, the scale model of ReVolt, has sensors for estimating own position and motion, and in the near future, the model will also be equiped with sensors for observing the world around, e.g. camera, lidar and microphone. 
Several students from NTNU have and will continue to work on ReVolt, both the physical ReVolt model and the simulated ReVolt model.
During the summer 2017, several tests will be performed on the ReVolt model, and the results will be published when they are available.
